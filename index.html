<p>My name is Michele Baker I’m 46 years old and I live in Clinton Utah, 30 minutes north of Salt Lake City. I was born and raised in southern California,<br>
and moved to the Pacific Northwest Washington when I was 14. I graduated from Port Angeles High School in 1995, and after graduating I attended <br>
Shoreline Community College. My aspirations were to get my degree in Marine Biology and play college softball. I shortly figured out that college was not <br>
for me, I dropped out after one semester. I moved back home with my parents and my father gave me an ultimatum to enter the work force or join the military.<br>
I researched all the branched and decided to enlist in the Navy which I was the first enlisted Navy in my family.</em></p> 
<p>In April of 1997 I left for bootcamp in Great Lakes Illinois. After graduating bootcamp I went to “A” School wh ch gives sailors a basic understanding of <br>
what shipboard life will be like. I learned how to combat fires, fix leaks in water pipes to prevent flooding. I also learned more about the technical aspects <br>
of the different types of ships and what purpose each one had to protect our nation. From there I went to “C” school, which was my specific job, I had a <br>
guaranteed rate of Engineman (my job entering the military). There I learned how to maintain, troubleshoot, and operate systems that keep ships running.<br>
I learned about engines which are used for auxiliary power and main propulsion. Galley equipment ranging from refrigerators to food mixers. One of the <br>
heart and sole of the ship, fresh water, l learned on the working of distilling plants salt water comes in potable water comes out. I really excelled in <br>
my career field; I achieved the rank of Petty Officer 2nd Class in my four years. I earned many decorations, but I have two that I’m really proud of. <br>
While I was a young “Seamen” I completed my Enlisted Surface Warfare pin. I spent three months studying every aspect of the ship I was assigned to. I had <br>
to visit and be trained on every element of the ship. Still as a young “Seamen”, I also was awarded the great honor of being named Sailor of the Year.<br>
I competed with five other sailors and won. But in the end the Navy wasn’t for me either. I was discharged in April of 2001.</em></p> 
<p>I left my ship and moved to Las Vegas Nevada, where I struggled with transitioning from military to civilian life. I had made the decision to reenlist <br>
into the military, knowing I was not going back into the Navy,the Air Force was my first choice. Since I was prior enlisted, I did not have to go to basic <br>
training, I went straight to my assigned location of Hill Air Force Base in Utah. On September 11, 2001. I was sitting at the Military Entrance Processing Station<br>
in Salt Lake City awaiting my turn to process in the Air Force. I saw the events unfold on that faithful day that our great nation was attached by terrorist.<br>
They evacuated the station and were told to come by the next day. I was one of two individuals that enlisted on 12 September 2001. For the next 16 years <br>
Hill Air Force Base was called home. My job was an Aerospace Ground Equipment technician. I maintained all the equipment to support 87 assigned F-16s.<br>
I did deploy to Iraq once and Afghanistan twice. I fulfilled my 20-year obligation on October 1, 2017, when I officially retired from active-duty military service.</em></p> 
<p>After retirement from the military, I joined the civilian workforce. I started as a contractor refurbishing aircraft bomb loader. I did that for five years<br>
then decided to change career field, I got an IT job in the spring of 2022. This brings me to right now, where I’m now back in college getting my degree in Computer Science.</em></p>
<p>I’ve been an avid woodworker for about 10 years, I love to take a pile of wood and turn it into something that can be used or just look good. I'm really big on <br>
remodeling my house at the moment. I've built a stone fireplace wall where i installed an electric fireplace. This summer I replace all the hardwood flooring with a <br>
diffrent syle of engineered hardwood. I also painted the whole interior main level. I love making little crafts for my family and friends to enjoy.</em></p><br><br>
