	<h1>About Michele Baker</h1>

<p> My name is Michele Baker I’m 46 years old and I live in Clinton Utah, 30 minutes north of Salt Lake City. I was born and raised in southern California, and moved to the Pacific Northwest Washington when I was 14.<br> 
I graduated from Port Angeles High School in 1995, and after graduating I attended Shoreline Community College. My aspirations were to get my degree in Marine Biology and play college softball.<br>
I shortly figured out that college was not for me, I dropped out after one semester. I moved back home with my parents and my father gave me an ultimatum to enter the work force or join the military.<br>
I researched all the branched and decided to enlist in the Navy which I was the first enlisted Navy in my family.</em></p> 
<p>In April of 1997 I left for bootcamp in Great Lakes Illinois. After graduating bootcamp I went to “A” School which gives sailors a basic understanding of what shipboard life will be like.<br>
I learned how to combat fires, fix leaks in water pipes to prevent flooding. I also learned more about the technical aspects of the different types of ships and what purpose each one had to protect our nation.<br>
From there I went to “C” school, which was my specific job, I had a guaranteed rate of Engineman (my job entering the military). There I learned how to maintain, troubleshoot, and operate systems that keep ships running.<br>
I learned about engines which are used for auxiliary power and main propulsion. Galley equipment ranging from refrigerators to food mixers. One of the heart and sole of the ship, fresh water, l learned on the working of <br>
distilling plants salt water comes in potable water comes out. I really excelled in my career field; I achieved the rank of Petty Officer 2nd Class in my four years. I earned many decorations, but I have two that I’m <br>
really proud of. While I was a young “Seamen” I completed my Enlisted Surface Warfare pin. I spent three months studying every aspect of the ship I was assigned to. I had to visit and be trained on every element of the<br>
ship. Still as a young “Seamen”, I also was awarded the great honor of being named Sailor of the Year. I competed with five other sailors and won. But in the end the Navy wasn’t for me either. I was discharged in April of 2001.</em></p> 
<p>I left my ship and moved to Las Vegas Nevada, where I struggled with transitioning from military to civilian life. I had made the decision to reenlist into the military, knowing I was not going back into the Navy,<br>
the Air Force was my first choice. Since I was prior enlisted, I did not have to go to basic training, I went straight to my assigned location of Hill Air Force Base in Utah. On September 11, 2001. I was sitting at<br>
the Military Entrance Processing Station in Salt Lake City awaiting my turn to process in the Air Force. I saw the events unfold on that faithful day that our great nation was attached by terrorist. They evacuated <br>
the station and were told to come by the next day. I was one of two individuals that enlisted on 12 September 2001. For the next 16 years Hill Air Force Base was called home. My job was an Aerospace Ground Equipment<br>
technician. I maintained all the equipment to support 87 assigned F-16s. I did deploy to Iraq once and Afghanistan twice. I fulfilled my 20-year obligation on October 1, 2017, when I officially retired from active-duty<br>
military service.</em></p> 
<p>After retirement from the military, I joined the civilian workforce. I started as a contractor refurbishing aircraft bomb loader. I did that for five years then decided to change career field, I got an IT job in the<br>
spring of 2022. This brings me to right now, where I’m now back in college getting my degree in Computer Science.</em></p>
<p>I’ve been an avid woodworker for about 10 years, I love to take a pile of wood and turn it into something that can be used or just look good. I enjoy home remodeling as well little crafts.</em></p><br><br>
